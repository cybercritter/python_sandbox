# python_sandbox

I needed a place to code new ideas for my Python code before integrating them into a product.

### A place to play

Here is a list of the directories and what is in them.

1. OOP - working with python in an object oriented design. I have used c++ for many years and needed to learn how python does it.

### There will be more directories added.

Some items I will be mocking up

1. decorators
2. os manipulation. This will simple things lik filesystem interfaces and such
3. networking. This will entail creating a simple TCP/UDP application, getting things directly from the wire and parsing the packet. Creating a new simple protocol that handles basic transmission and reception of messages.

There will be other ideas added soon.
